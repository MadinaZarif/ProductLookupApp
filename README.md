# 🧾 Product Lookup App

This is a small Java desktop application that helps identify products by their numeric codes. It was inspired by my real-life experience working as a cashier.

## 🛍️ How it started

In 2024, I decided to find a job where I could interact with more people and practice speaking German. And where can you find the most people? — Of course, in supermarkets!

That's how I started working at **Penny** as a cashier. I was given a list of product codes that I had to memorize. Curious about how the POS (Point of Sale) system works, I decided to try and build a simple version of it myself — just for learning and fun.

Of course, this app is much simpler than a real retail system. But this project gave me:
- A better understanding of how cashier systems work;
- Hands-on experience building a GUI with Java Swing;
- A useful way to memorize all those product codes.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
